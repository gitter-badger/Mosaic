{"name":"Mosaic","tagline":"Mosaic Windows Tile Management","body":"ABOUT MOSAIC WINDOWS\r\n====================\r\nThis app is the result of my procrastination while working on another app.\r\n\r\n> *Benchley:*\r\n> *Anyone can do any amount of work, provided it isnâ€™t the work he is supposed to be doing at that moment.*\r\n\r\nI'm using it on Windows 10 and haven't tested it on other versions. This program is in Alpha but it works.\r\n\r\nHow to trigger Mosaic\r\n---------------------\r\nThere are two modes to use Mosaic which you can select by right clicking the system tray icon (to the right of Task Bar).\r\n\r\n1. Edge Activation Mode\r\n 1 Grab a window title bar > move it to an edges/corner of the screen to pin one edge/corner > move the pointer to the opposite direction to draw the window\r\n 2 Grab a window title bar > move it to a desired location > press right mouse button to pin one edge/corner > move the pointer to draw the window\r\n\r\n2. Always Active Mode\r\n - The anchor point alternates between the (side) edges of the screen\r\n - Hold any of the mod keys (Alt, Ctrl, Shift) before grabbing a window to prevent Mosaic activation\r\n\r\n> Note:\r\n> \t - Right mouse button or Esc key will cancel Mosaic if it is activated.\r\n> \t - Double clicking the tray icon will disable Mosaic until it is enabled or the app is restarted\r\n\r\n \r\nGrid Size\r\n---------\r\n - Use mouse wheel to change the grid size while Mosaic is active. \r\n - Grid width and/or height will be adjusted depending on the edge by which Mosaic is triggered. Bear in mind that in \"Always Active Mode\" side edges are triggered automatically so you can't adjust the grid height independent from grid width.\r\n\r\nOverlay Window\r\n--------------\r\n - Enable \"Overlay Window\" if constant re-sizing of the window is disturbing.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
